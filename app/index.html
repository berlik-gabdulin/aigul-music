					<h3>Hi,</h3>
					<p><b>This is Aigül. So nice to meet you.</b></p>
					<p>I believe that life is about evolving, getting to know oneself, creating, and putting the talents only you have in service of something bigger than who you are. I’m in an endless process of getting to know myself better and better every day, and I go there with open-ended curiosity.</p>
					<p>But I can tell you for sure that I’m a great music fan and I love creating music too. If you love music and love creating stuff, then we are in the same tribe! Anyhow, I’m glad you’re here.</p>
